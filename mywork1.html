            <h1>Hungry Hungry <span class="pink">Hydra</span> Project</h1>
            <p>The Fantasy Cafe/Bakery Game is a charming and immersive game where players interact with a hungry, multi-headed dragon to appease its hunger with cute baked goods. As the UX/UI designer for this project, my role was to create an engaging and intuitive user interface that would enhance the gameplay experience and foster a mutually beneficial relationship between the players and the dragon.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>For this school coding project, I was tasked with creating a website for a recipe of my choice using CSS Grid. The focus of the project was to create a responsive design, which required me to explore new web technologies and develop my skills in web development and design. Throughout the project, I was able to showcase my creativity by designing a visually appealing website that effectively presented my chosen recipe. Overall, this project challenged me to push my limits and develop new skills while exploring the exciting world of web development.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The main user problem was the lack of an intuitive and visually appealing user interface in the initial version of the game. Players found it challenging to navigate and understand the gameplay mechanics, leading to a less enjoyable experience. Additionally, the game lacked a clear progression system and meaningful interaction with the dragon character.            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h3>User Goals</h3>
            <p>Players wanted an immersive and enjoyable experience, with clear objectives and engaging gameplay mechanics. They desired to feel a sense of achievement as they progressed in the game and successfully served the dragon with delicious pastries.</p>
            <h3>Business Goals</h3>
            <p>The game aimed to increase player engagement, retention, and monetization through in-app purchases of additional recipes, ingredients, and cosmetic items.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Research and Analysis</h3>
            <p>Conducted competitor analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses of similar games in the genre.<br>
                Performed user research, including surveys and interviews, to understand player preferences, pain points, and desired features.<br>
                Analyzed feedback from initial game release to identify specific areas of improvement.</p>
            <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the key screens and interactions within the game.<br>
                Iterated on the wireframes based on feedback from the development team and user testing sessions.<br>
                Developed interactive prototypes using design tools to test the flow and usability of the interface.</p>
            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <p>Developed a visual style that aligned with the charming and fantasy-themed nature of the game.<br>
                Designed icons, buttons, and visual elements to reflect the bakery/cafe theme and appeal to the target audience.<br>
                Incorporated vibrant colors and playful illustrations to enhance the overall visual appeal.</p>
            <h3>Iterative Design and Testing</h3>
            <p>Collaborated closely with the development team to implement the user interface and ensure design fidelity.<br>
                Conducted usability testing sessions with players to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.<br>
                Iterated on the UI design based on user feedback and usability testing results.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>Player engagement and retention increased significantly after the UI redesign, as players found the new interface more intuitive and visually appealing.<br>
            Positive word-of-mouth increased as players shared their enjoyable experiences with friends and online communities.
